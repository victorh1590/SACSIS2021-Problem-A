# UFV SACSIS 2021 Programming Marathon - Problem A Solution

## Problem Description
*TO DO*

## How to run the code?

### Dependencies
The test framework RSpec is the only dependency for this exercise.
You can download the gem directly by running the command:
```
$ gem install rspec -v '>= 3.10'
```

**OR** in case you have bundler installed:
```
$ bundle install
```

### Test
Before running the code, try running the tests. In the directory root, run:
```
$ rspec
```

If the code passes the test, the output will be like:
```
......

6 examples, 0 failures
```

### Code
To run the code from the root directory, use:
```
$ ruby lib/main.rb input.txt
```
